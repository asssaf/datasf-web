# Implementation Plan - Build core CLI API query functionality with dynamic parameters and JSON output

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core CLI Structure
- [ ] Task: Initialize Python project and directory structure
    - [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with `click` and `requests`
    - [ ] Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
- [ ] Task: Implement basic CLI entry point with Click
    - [ ] Write tests for CLI argument parsing
    - [ ] Implement `main` function with basic command and flags
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Project Setup and Core CLI Structure' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: API Interaction and Dynamic Parameters
- [ ] Task: Implement core API request logic
    - [ ] Write tests for basic GET request execution
    - [ ] Implement `api_client` module using `requests`
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Implement dynamic parameter mapping
    - [ ] Write tests for mapping multiple flags to query parameters
    - [ ] Implement logic to collect flags and pass them to the API request
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: API Interaction and Dynamic Parameters' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Authentication and Secure Communication
- [ ] Task: Implement API authentication
    - [ ] Write tests for passing authentication headers (Bearer/API Key)
    - [ ] Implement authentication flag and header injection logic
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Ensure secure HTTPS communication
    - [ ] Write tests for SSL/TLS verification and error handling
    - [ ] Implement secure request defaults
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Authentication and Secure Communication' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Output Formatting and Final Polishing
- [ ] Task: Implement JSON output formatting
    - [ ] Write tests for JSON formatting and error output
    - [ ] Implement `formatter` module to pretty-print JSON responses
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Implement robust error handling and help system
    - [ ] Write tests for various error scenarios (4xx, 5xx, network timeout)
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive error messages and built-in help
    - [ ] Verify coverage > 80%
- [ ] Task: Prepare for standalone binary compilation
    - [ ] Set up PyInstaller configuration
    - [ ] Verify the build process and basic functionality of the binary
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Output Formatting and Final Polishing' (Protocol in workflow.md)
