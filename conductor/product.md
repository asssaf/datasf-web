## Product Definition

### Overview
A CLI application designed for power users to execute queries against a REST API. It handles multiple query arguments and presents formatted output while ensuring robust error handling and secure communications.

### Target Audience
- **Power Users**: Individuals who prefer the command line for rapid data retrieval and complex query execution.

### Key Features
- **Multiple Query Arguments**: Support for passing various query parameters as command-line arguments to the API endpoint.

### Functional Goals
- **API Execution**: Perform reliable queries against specified REST endpoints.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handle network failures and API errors to provide clear feedback to the user.

### Non-Functional Requirements (Constraints)
- **Standalone Executable**: The application should be distributed as a single binary for ease of installation and use.
- **Secure Communication (HTTPS)**: All API interactions must be performed over HTTPS to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
